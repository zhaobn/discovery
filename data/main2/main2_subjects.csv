If you find a fusion that works when you extract it you get 150 points instead of 100 for a single resource. You can make even more complex fusions or apparently fusions of fusions but the problem here is that youre wasting turns experimenting which all these fusions so even though complex fusions are worth more you dont have enough turns to extract so you end up making less overall.","Im sure there are a few players out there smarter than me who came up with an amazing complex fusion worth a gazillion points that took them 9 turns to develop and then played it on their remaining turn.
