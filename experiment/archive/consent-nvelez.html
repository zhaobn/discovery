          This HIT is part of a scientific research project at Princeton University. Your decision to complete this HIT is voluntary. There is no way for us to identify you. The only information we will have, in addition to your responses, is the time at which you completed the survey. The results of the research may be presented at scientific meetings or published in scientific journals. Clicking on the <q>SUBMIT</q> button at the bottom of this page indicates that you are at least 18 years of age and agree to complete this HIT voluntarily.

          <br>

          <b>Risks:</b>


          The effects of participating should be comparable to those you would experience from viewing a computer monitor for the task duration and using a mouse or keyboard.

          <b>Confidentiality:</b>

          We will not ask for any personally identifying information and will collect, analyze, and store your responses as confidentially as possible. Your name or your Worker IDs will never be tied to your responses in this study. However, we cannot guarantee the confidentiality of information transmitted over the Internet. To minimize this risk, data containing anything that might be personally identifiable (e.g., Worker IDs) will be encrypted on transfer and storage and will only be accessible to authorized research personnel. We will keep the data collected as part of this experiment indefinitely.
