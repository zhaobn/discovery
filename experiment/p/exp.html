        <hr>


        You are being invited to take part in a research study. Before you decide to participate in this study, it is important that you understand why the research is being done and what it will involve.

        Please take the time to read the following information carefully.

        Please ask the researcher if there is anything that is not clear or if you need more information.


        <br>
        <br>

        <b>Purpose of the research:</b>


        This project aims to collect data that can be used to evaluate formal accounts of causal learning,

        categorization, and language learning and to track how knowledge about these areas is transformed when passed from person to person.


        <br>
        <br>


        <b>Study Procedures:</b>


        You will be presented with some information (e.g., a written narrative, hypothetical scenarios, or scientific data) and will then be asked to make one or more judgments about that information, or decisions based
         upon it.

        In some cases you will be asked to provide explanations or justifications for your responses, typically in the form of a short paragraph.

        The task will not involve deception or emotionally disturbing materials - just simple questions about categories, causal relationships, and languages.

        The task you will perform will be one or more of the following:

        <ol>

        <li>Being shown a set of members of a category, and then asked to indicate which other objects are likely to belong to the category.</li>

        <li>Being presented a sequence of pictures or sounds, and being asked to predict the next item in the sequence. </li>

        <li>Being told a set of words in a language, and then making judgments about whether other words belong to the language.</li>

        <li>Being shown statistical information about the interaction of causes and effects, and then making judgments about the causal relationships involved.</li>

        <li>Observing a set of events or reading a description or information, and then evaluating the probability of events or statements.</li>

        <li>Being presented with one or more visual puzzles and re-arranging elements on a screen to solve them. </li>

        <li>Being presented with visual stimuli and making a quantitative or qualitative judgment on the basis of said stimuli.

        <li>Interacting with one or more participants about shared stimuli using a chat box.</li>

        <li>Making a decision about an action to take based on quantitative or qualitative information. </li>

        <li>Being shown a list of words and/or pictures, and then being asked to recall them.</li>

        </ol>

        The answers you provide in the task may be used as stimuli for future participants.

        However, data that would identify you will not be shared with other participants.

        <br>

        Your total expected time commitment for this study is: <b>8 minutes</b>.


        <br>
        <br>

        <b>Benefits and Risks:</b>


        There are no direct benefits to you as a participant;

        however, by furthering our understanding of human cognition,

        this research will benefit society by helping with the development of automated systems

        that can better solve problems that are computationally challenging,

        but that people can solve easily with little formal guidance.

        <br>
        <br>

        Risks associated with participation in this study are minimal.

        You may feel slight discomfort answering some questions,

        but you may refrain from answering any questions that make you uncomfortable

        and may withdraw your participation at any time even after completing the experiment without penalty.


        <br>
        <br>

        <b>Confidentiality: </b>


        We will not be asking for any personally identifying information,

        and we will handle responses as confidentially as possible.

        Your name, or your Worker IDs will never be tied to your responses on this survey.

        However, we cannot guarantee the confidentiality of information transmitted over the Internet.

        To minimize this risk, data containing anything that might be personally identifiable

        (e.g. Worker IDs) will be encrypted on transfer and storage and will only be accessible

        to qualified lab personnel. We will be keeping data collected as part of this experiment indefinitely.

        This anonymized data (containing neither Worker IDs nor IP addresses)

        may be shared with the scientific community and corporate sponsors.

        At the end of the survey you may be asked if you would like to provide your email or MTurk ID

        to be contacted to participate in future studies., If you choose to provide this information,

        you may be contacted for participation in future studies.


        <br>
        <br>

        <b>Compensation:</b>

        For your participation, you will receive <b>$2.00 plus a bonus that will depend on your performance during a series of games</b>

        <br>

        If you are on MTurk or Prolific and for any reason you do not complete the study

        (e.g. technical difficulties, or a desire to stop),

        we will only be able to pay you if you send an email through MTurk/Prolific,

        or by emailing the researcher, at cocosci-lab@princeton.edu.

        If you have any questions about the study,

        feel free to contact the researcher or

        the Principal Investigator, Thomas Griffiths, at tomg@princeton.edu.

              <p>These labels <b>just refer to the locations</b> of the crystals in this particular batch, not the properties of the crystals themselves.</p>
              <p>You can put a crystal into the machine by clicking its label.</p>
              <p>Try it.</p>

          <p>Well done.</p>
          <p>When there is one crystal in the machine, you can harvest the energy points inside a crystal by clicking the <q>Extract</q> button.</p>
          <p>Try it.</p>

          <p>Great.</p>
          <p>Note that the total energy you gathered so far is shown on top of the machine.</p>

          <p>What if you mistakenly placed a crystal? You can remove a crystal from the machine by clicking the crystal in the machine.</p>

        <div id="intro-sub-2-1">
          <p>Besides extracting energy, the machine also has a <q>Fuse</q> button.</p>
          <p>If you put two crystals into the machine, and click the <q>Fuse</q> button, the machine will try to fuse the two crystals together.</p>
          <p><strong>Sometimes this fusion leads to a new crystal, </strong>and the resulting crystal will be shown in the smaller box. The label on the crystal tells you which crystals went into making it (remember, the letters don't tell you anything other than the location of the crystals for this batch).</p>
          <p>The production team can deliver you this newly discovered crystal for future tests. Again, as many as you need.</p>
          <p><strong>Sometimes the fusion leads to nothing, </strong>and you just lose a chance of extracting energy points from known crystals.</p>
          <p>Try playing with the <q>Fuse</q> process until you discover new crystals.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="intro-sub-2-2" style="display: none;">
          <p>Each new crystal you discover is worth twice as many energy points as the most valuable crystal used to produce it.</p>
          <p>For example, to make this new crystal, you combined two simple crystals that were worth 10 energy points each; the new crystal you discovered is now worth 20 points.</p>
          <p>Try putting a fused crystal into the machine, and then extract it. </p>

          <p>Good job!</p>
          <p>Your failed <q>Fuse</q> attempts are shown on the left. So that you know what to avoid.</p>
          <p>Repeating a successful fusion makes no further changes. To gather energy points from your fused crystal, use the <q>Extract</q> button.</p>
          <p>Also, you can use fused crystals to fuse more advanced crystals that have even higher energy points.</p>

        <div id="intro-sub-2-4" style="display:none;">
          <p>You will be playing this game with serveral batches of alien crystals. <b>Each new batch has a new set of crystals, indicated by different colors.</b>
          <p>Again, letters are just markers of locations for the crystals in each particular batch, not their properties.</p>
          <p>You will also win an extra bonus, proportional to how many energy points you gathered in total.</p>
          <div class='button-group-vc'>

          <p>Finally, there is a <b>limited amount of button presses</b> you can make, for each machine.</p>
          <p>The amount of button presses left is indicated by the bars on the top rim of the machine.</p>

        <ul>
          <!-- <li>Your goal is to maximize the total energy you gather from using the machine.</li> -->
          <li>You can gather energy from a single crystal by placing it in the machine and clicking the <q>Extract</q> button.</li>
          <li>You may discover new crystals by placing two known crystals in the machine and clicking the <q>Fuse</q> button.</li>
          <li>All of the initial simple crystals in each batch have the same amount of energy points.</li>
          <li>New crystals have twice as much energy as the most valuable crystal that was used in the fusion.</li>
          <li>Sometimes fusion works out, and sometimes it does not.</li>
          <!-- <li>Any failed, or successful, discovery, will not change furthermore.</li> -->
          <li>A new set of crystals is used for each task, and the letters on the crystals only refer to their locations in a batch.</li>
          <li>There is a limited number of button presses you can make for each machine, displayed on the upper rim of the machine.</li>
          <li>Your goal is to maximize the <b>total energy</b> you gather from using the machine. Your bonus is proportional to this total.</li>
