        You are being invited to take part in a research study. Before you decide to participate in this study, it is important that you understand why the research is being done and what it will involve.

        Please take the time to read the following information carefully.

        Please ask the researcher if there is anything that is not clear or if you need more information.


        <br>
        <br>

        <b>Purpose of the research:</b>


        This project aims to collect data that can be used to evaluate formal accounts of causal learning,

        categorization, and language learning and to track how knowledge about these areas is transformed when passed from person to person.


        <br>
        <br>


        <b>Study Procedures:</b>


        You will be presented with some information (e.g., a written narrative, hypothetical scenarios, or scientific data) and will then be asked to make one or more judgments about that information, or decisions based
         upon it.

        In some cases you will be asked to provide explanations or justifications for your responses, typically in the form of a short paragraph.

        The task will not involve deception or emotionally disturbing materials - just simple questions about categories, causal relationships, and languages.

        The task you will perform will be one or more of the following:

        <ol>

        <li>Being shown a set of members of a category, and then asked to indicate which other objects are likely to belong to the category.</li>

        <li>Being presented a sequence of pictures or sounds, and being asked to predict the next item in the sequence. </li>

        <li>Being told a set of words in a language, and then making judgments about whether other words belong to the language.</li>

        <li>Being shown statistical information about the interaction of causes and effects, and then making judgments about the causal relationships involved.</li>

        <li>Observing a set of events or reading a description or information, and then evaluating the probability of events or statements.</li>

        <li>Being presented with one or more visual puzzles and re-arranging elements on a screen to solve them. </li>

        <li>Being presented with visual stimuli and making a quantitative or qualitative judgment on the basis of said stimuli.

        <li>Interacting with one or more participants about shared stimuli using a chat box.</li>

        <li>Making a decision about an action to take based on quantitative or qualitative information. </li>

        <li>Being shown a list of words and/or pictures, and then being asked to recall them.</li>

        </ol>

        The answers you provide in the task may be used as stimuli for future participants.

        However, data that would identify you will not be shared with other participants.

        <br>

        Your total expected time commitment for this study is: <b>10 minutes</b>.


        <br>
        <br>

        <b>Benefits and Risks:</b>


        There are no direct benefits to you as a participant;

        however, by furthering our understanding of human cognition,

        this research will benefit society by helping with the development of automated systems

        that can better solve problems that are computationally challenging,

        but that people can solve easily with little formal guidance.

        <br>
        <br>

        Risks associated with participation in this study are minimal.

        You may feel slight discomfort answering some questions,

        but you may refrain from answering any questions that make you uncomfortable

        and may withdraw your participation at any time even after completing the experiment without penalty.


        <br>
        <br>

        <b>Confidentiality: </b>


        We will not be asking for any personally identifying information,

        and we will handle responses as confidentially as possible.

        Your name, or your Worker IDs will never be tied to your responses on this survey.

        However, we cannot guarantee the confidentiality of information transmitted over the Internet.

        To minimize this risk, data containing anything that might be personally identifiable

        (e.g. Worker IDs) will be encrypted on transfer and storage and will only be accessible

        to qualified lab personnel. We will be keeping data collected as part of this experiment indefinitely.

        This anonymized data (containing neither Worker IDs nor IP addresses)

        may be shared with the scientific community and corporate sponsors.

        At the end of the survey you may be asked if you would like to provide your email or MTurk ID

        to be contacted to participate in future studies., If you choose to provide this information,

        you may be contacted for participation in future studies.


        <br>
        <br>

        <b>Compensation:</b>

        For your participation, you will receive <b>$2.00 plus a bonus that will depend on your performance during a series of games</b>

        <br>

        If you are on MTurk or Prolific and for any reason you do not complete the study

        (e.g. technical difficulties, or a desire to stop),

        we will only be able to pay you if you send an email through MTurk/Prolific,

        or by emailing the researcher, at cocosci-lab@princeton.edu.

        If you have any questions about the study,

        feel free to contact the researcher or

        the Principal Investigator, Thomas Griffiths, at tomg@princeton.edu.

            <p>For your mission, a production team will supply alien crystals to you, as many as you need. These supplies are labeled below the machine.</p>
            <p>Researchers already measured the energy points of some of the alien crystals, indicated by the gray numbers below each label.</p>
            <p><b>Note that the crystals available to you will be different in each round.</b> The label on each crystal just refers to the order in which it was received - for example, crystal <q>a</q> is just the first crystal you receive in each batch, but what crystal that corresponds to may be different in every batch.</p>

          <p>Engineers have added a <b>Fuse</b> button to your machine</p>
          <p>If you put two crystals into the machine, and click the Fuse button, the machine will try to fuse the two crystals together.</p>
          <p><strong>Sometimes fusion leads to a new crystal, </strong>and the resulting crystal will be shown in the smaller box. </p>
          <p><strong>Sometimes fusion leads to nothing, </strong>and you just missed out on a chance to extract energy points from known crystals.</p>
          <p>Try playing with the Fuse process until you discover new crystals.</p>

          <p>In each game, you will only have <strong>10 opportunities to press buttons</strong>. Fusing <i>new</i> combinations and Extracting crystals each use one button press.</p>
          <!-- <p>If you accidentally repeat a previously discovered or failed fusion, it will not consume a chance to use the machine. You can see combinations you have tried on the list on the right hand side of the machine.</p> -->
          <p>The number of button presses remaining is indicated by the bars on the top rim of the machine. There are now two bars left – take two more actions with this machine (push Extract or Fuse buttons) to end the instructions.</p>
